LaTeX macros and style files for typesetting various aspects of a programming course.

This is a collection of macros that is meant for typesetting exams, slides, lecture nodes,
code listings and other material that is needed for a programming course.

These macros are mostly based on other packages, adding some additional features and
macros that may be useful for courses.

== Remarks

There is a go module defined in this repository because there are examples containing
source code in the `go` language. The module is not used for anything else.
This simplifies the use of the examples in VSCode.
