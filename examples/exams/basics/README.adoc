= Common Exam Examples

These are examples of exams that use a common set of task, but with different configurations.
There are two `.tex` files for each example, one with solutions enabled and one without.

== `exam_plain`

This is the simplest way to use the package.
The `.tex` files don't set any options, so the default values are used.

== `exam_defaults`

This is an example of an exam where all options are explicitly set to their default values.
This should produce the same pdfs as the `plain` example.

== `exam_defaults_de`

This is an example of an exam where the language option [de] is used and
all options are explicitly set to their default values.

== `exam_no_cover`

This is an example of an exam where the cover page is not shown.

== `exam_custom_cover`

This is an example of an exam where a custom cover page is used.
