= Exams

This directory contains examples for typesetting exams.
It builds on the exam package and defines additional commands that simplify
writing exams.

== Features ==

* There is a custom `\task` command for defining tasks.
    ** It takes two arguments: the task's title (optional) and the task's points.
    ** I don't use the `\titledquestion` command, because that would use the
       question title in the grading table, which is not what I want.
    ** Instead, I use my own `\task` command and define task title that is used
       in the task itself (using `\qformat`), but not in the grading table.
* There are custom commands for defining the exam's title, date, and duration.
  For the title, there are short and long versions that are used in the header
  and the title page, respectively.
